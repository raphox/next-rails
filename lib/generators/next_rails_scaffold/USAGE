Description:
    The `next_rails_scaffold` gem enhances the default Ruby on Rails scaffold generator by seamlessly integrating with Next.js, a React framework. This gem automates the process of scaffolding a Rails application along with a corresponding frontend directory containing a Next.js application. The generated Next.js app includes all necessary pages and components, leveraging the power of page routing for a smooth and organized development experience.

Example:
    bin/rails generate scaffold Post tile:string body:text

    This will create:

        app/
          controllers/
            posts_controller.rb
          models/
            post.rb
          ...
        frontend/
          src
            pages
              posts
                [id]
                  edit.js
                  index.js
                _components
                  Post.js
                  PostForm.js
                index.js
                new.js
              services.js
